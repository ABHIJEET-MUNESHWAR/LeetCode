### 📜 Problem Description

Given two strings  `s`  and  `t` ,  *determine if they are isomorphic* .

Two strings  `s`  and  `t`  are isomorphic if the characters in  `s`  can be replaced to get  `t` .

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  s = "egg", t = "add"

**Output:**  true

**Explanation:**

The strings  `s`  and  `t`  can be made identical by:

	
- Mapping  `'e'`  to  `'a'` .
	
- Mapping  `'g'`  to  `'d'` .

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  s = "f11", t = "b23"

**Output:**  false

**Explanation:**

The strings  `s`  and  `t`  can not be made identical as  `'1'`  needs to be mapped to both  `'2'`  and  `'3'` .

**Example 3:**

**Input:**  s = "paper", t = "title"

**Output:**  true

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
	
- `t.length == s.length`
	
- `s`  and  `t`  consist of any valid ascii character.
