ðŸŸ  Cheapest bank route

Description

International bank transfers can sometimes be very complicated with Adyen's money going through multiple intermediary banks (each taking a cut) before they reach their destination. Since Adyen executes a lot of transfers - it's worthwhile to find the cheapest routes. At the same time - we don't want the transfer to go through too many intermediaries as that may cause delays.

Given a destination bank, list of routes including costs and a maximum number of intermediary banks - return the cost of the cheapest route between Adyen and the destination bank or -1 if no such route exists.

Example test case:

We want to find a route to Chase, with at most 1 intermediary bank. The available routes are as follows:
Adyen to BoA with a cost of 10
BoA to Wells with a cost of 10
Wells to Adyen with a cost of 10
BoA to Chase with a cost of 60
Wells to Chase with a cost of 20

There's 2 routes to Chase - Adyen to BoA to Wells to Chase (10+10+20=40) and Adyen to BoA to Chase (10+60=70).
The first route is cheaper, but goes through 2 intermediary banks; the cheapest route going through no more than 1 intermediary is therefore the second one, with a cost of 70.
